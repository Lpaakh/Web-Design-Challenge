## Welcome to LPaakhMay's Web-Design-Challenge

Click this [link](https://lpaakh.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/landing.html) to view the website I created that explains and visualizes LPaakhMay's analysis.

### What is this?

This challenge was a homework assignment from my Data Science and Visualization boot camp course through the University of California San Diego extension program, Trilogy. I was taught how to work with html, css and bootstrap, and then applied the rhetoric taught in the course by following a list of website requirements on a deadline the week after it was taught.

### How to use:

The link above takes the user to the landing page. The landing page gives a summary of what was analyzed, how the data was collected and how the visualizations were created. One there the user will be presented with options:
- Use the navigation bar to (from left to right) 
    1. View plots for latitude vs. maximum temperature data, humidity, cloudiness or wind speed.
    2. A comparison analysis of all weather aspects.
    3. The full data set that was collected and used for the analysis.
- Use the images under the Visualizations heading to go to one specific weather aspect's analysis.

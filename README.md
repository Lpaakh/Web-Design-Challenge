## Welcome to LPaakhMay's Web-Design-Challenge

Click this [link](https://lpaakh.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/landing.html) to view the website LPaakhMay's created that explains and visualizes her analysis.

### What is this?

This challenge was a homework assignment from LPaakhMay's Data Science and Visualization boot camp course through the University of California San Diego extension program, Trilogy. She was taught how to work with html, css and bootstrap, and then applied the rhetoric taught in the course by following a list of website requirements on a deadline the week after it was taught.

### How to use:

The link above takes the user to the landing page. The landing page gives a summary of what was analyzed, how the data was collected and how the visualizations were created. One there the user will be presented with options:
- Use the navigation bar to (from left to right) 
    1. View plots for latitude vs. maximum temperature data, humidity, cloudiness or wind speed.
    2. A comparison analysis of all weather aspects.
    3. The full data set that was collected and used for the analysis.
- Use the images under the Visualizations heading to go to one specific weather aspect's analysis.
